   - Builds on WP5 (mentor matching)

6. Work Package 8: Protocol Guidance System
   - Depends on WP3 (user profiles) and WP6 (missions)
   - Integrates with WP7 (mentoring sessions)

7. Work Package 9: Analytics and Reporting System
   - Depends on all previous packages for data collection
   - Can be implemented incrementally alongside other packages

8. Work Package 10: Admin Panel and System Management
   - Final package that provides administration for all previous features

## Database Extensions Required

The following database extensions are needed beyond what's already implemented in WP2:

1. User profile extensions (preferences, career goals, skills)
2. AI mentor interaction history and feedback
3. Mission templates and user progress tracking
4. Protocol templates and customization data
5. Analytics events and aggregated metrics
6. Admin configuration and settings

Each work package will include the necessary model extensions, controllers, routes, and services to fully implement the required functionality.
